# Manager Identity Continuity

## Purpose

Define how a Manager preserves user and project continuity independent of device.

## Key Concepts

- Identity-bound context rather than hardware-bound session.
- Persistent project memory and role history.
- Traceable continuity during handoff and recovery.

## Relationship to Polaris Architecture

Identity continuity allows Boards and Projects to remain coherent across environments in MUX.

## Open Questions

- Which identity attributes are mandatory for portability?
