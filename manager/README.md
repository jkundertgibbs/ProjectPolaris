# Manager

## Purpose

Describe the Manager as Polaris's persistent orchestration layer.

## Key Concepts

- Identity continuity across devices and time.
- Delegation and role assignment.
- Escalation and feedback loops.
- Confirm/redirect/override interaction loop.

## Relationship to Polaris Architecture

Manager coordinates Board state, task flow, and governance policies while interfacing with attention inference.

## Open Questions

- Which manager functions should be local-only versus shareable?
