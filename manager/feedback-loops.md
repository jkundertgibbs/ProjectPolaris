# Feedback Loops and Escalation

## Purpose

Define horizontal and vertical feedback pathways managed by the Manager.

## Key Concepts

- Horizontal loops: peer review and cross-role correction.
- Vertical loops: escalation to higher authority roles.
- Confirm/redirect loop before high-impact actions.

## Relationship to Polaris Architecture

Feedback loops connect `governance/roles.md` with `attention/override-pattern.md` to preserve control and inspectability.

## Open Questions

- How should unresolved escalations timeout or re-route?
