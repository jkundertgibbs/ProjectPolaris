# Board Layout

## Purpose

Describe spatial patterns for Board composition and navigation.

## Key Concepts

- Stable anchor regions for projects and active tasks.
- Whiteboard mode for decomposition and re-structuring.
- HUD-like surfacing for urgent inferences and escalations.

## Relationship to Polaris Architecture

Layout patterns operationalize the Board's role as primary activity surface.

## Open Questions

- What layout adaptation rules preserve spatial memory on small screens?
