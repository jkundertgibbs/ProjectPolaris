# Design

## Purpose

Define interaction and spatial design constraints consistent with Polaris structure.

## Key Concepts

- Stable spatial mastery for repeatable workflows.
- Adaptive intensity for context-aware information density.
- Whiteboard and HUD-like interaction modes.

## Relationship to Polaris Architecture

Design constraints shape how Board, Attention, and Manager states are surfaced.

## Open Questions

- Which visual invariants must remain fixed across devices?
