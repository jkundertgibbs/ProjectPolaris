# Sample Design Images

## Purpose

This directory contains sample, draft images illustrating concepts discussed in Project Polaris.

## Key Concepts

- Images are exploratory visual references, not finalized designs.
- Images map to architecture themes such as board structure, governance, manager behavior, and attention intensity.
- Images should be interpreted alongside conceptual docs in `design/`, `manager/`, `attention/`, and `governance/`.

## Relationship to Polaris Architecture

These visuals support discussion of the Polaris model and help communicate structural concepts during architecture research.

## Open Questions

- Which visual conventions should become standardized across future interface specifications?
- Which draft artifacts should be promoted into formal design references?
