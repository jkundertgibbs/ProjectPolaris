# Runtime

## Purpose

Reserve implementation containers for future Polaris runtime components.

## Key Concepts

- Placeholder-only structure.
- No implementation logic in this phase.
- Alignment with conceptual architecture.

## Relationship to Polaris Architecture

Runtime directories map future execution surfaces to Board, Manager, Attention, UI, and protocol concerns.
