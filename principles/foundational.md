# Foundational Principles

## Purpose

Define baseline principles that all Polaris components must preserve.

## Key Concepts

- Tasks are primary.
- Stable structure, adaptive intensity.
- Inspectable inference.
- Explicit override authority.
- Feedback loops.
- Manager bound to identity.
- Markdown-native objects.
- Local-first, globally extensible.
- Budget as primitive.

## Relationship to Polaris Architecture

These principles shape Board decomposition, Manager authority, Attention inference policy, and Governance accountability.

## Open Questions

- How should principle conflicts be adjudicated in specs?
