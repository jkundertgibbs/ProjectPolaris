# Principles

## Purpose

Capture the non-negotiable conceptual foundations that define Polaris behavior and constraints.

## Key Concepts

- Foundational assumptions are stable across implementations.
- Structure and governance principles constrain spec design.
- Principles are upstream of interfaces in `specs/`.

## Relationship to Polaris Architecture

Principles define why Board, Manager, Attention, and Governance objects exist and how they must interact.

## Open Questions

- Which principles are strict invariants versus strong defaults?
