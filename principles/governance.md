# Governance Principles

## Purpose

Define authority, accountability, and override constraints for mixed human/AI operation.

## Key Concepts

- Explicit role ownership.
- Horizontal feedback loops within teams.
- Vertical escalation for unresolved decisions.
- Budget and risk-aware delegation.

## Relationship to Polaris Architecture

Governance principles inform role definitions in `governance/roles.md` and Manager escalation logic in `manager/feedback-loops.md`.

## Open Questions

- How should emergency override be audited and reviewed?
