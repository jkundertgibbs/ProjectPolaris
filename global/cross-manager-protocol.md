# Cross-Manager Protocol

## Purpose

Outline a draft protocol for manager-to-manager interaction.

## Key Concepts

- Capability advertisement and policy declaration.
- Structured task offer, accept, reject, and renegotiate messages.
- Auditability of negotiated outcomes.

## Relationship to Polaris Architecture

Protocol semantics connect global task exchange with local governance and manager controls.

## Open Questions

- How should trust and reputation be represented between managers?
