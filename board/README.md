# Board

## Purpose

Define the Board as Polaris's top-level activity surface, where missions are declared and tracked.

## Key Concepts

- Board is activity-based, not storage-based.
- Board anchors project visibility and status.
- Board organizes decomposition from project to task and subtask.

## Relationship to Polaris Architecture

The Board is the root of the operational flow: `Board -> Project -> Task -> Subtask`.

## Open Questions

- Should Boards be personal, team-scoped, or both by default?
- What archival model preserves inspectability without clutter?
