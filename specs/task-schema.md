# Task Schema (Draft)

Architecture draft - implementation TBD.

## Purpose

Define a minimal object model for tasks and recursive subtasks.

## Key Concepts

- Stable identifiers and parent-child lineage.
- Role assignment and verification fields.
- Budget, risk, and status metadata.

## Relationship to Polaris Architecture

This schema anchors the Board -> Project -> Task -> Subtask flow.

## Open Questions

- What schema versioning strategy supports cross-manager compatibility?
