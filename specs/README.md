# Specs

Architecture draft - implementation TBD.

## Purpose

Collect interface and schema drafts that formalize Polaris concepts without committing to runtime implementation.

## Key Concepts

- Specs translate principles into interoperable object contracts.
- Draft status is explicit and revision-friendly.
- Interfaces must preserve inspectability and override semantics.

## Relationship to Polaris Architecture

Specs operationalize Board, Task, Manager, and Attention models.

## Open Questions

- Which interfaces should stabilize first to enable prototype alignment?
