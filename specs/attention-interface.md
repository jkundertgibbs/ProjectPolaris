# Attention Interface (Draft)

Architecture draft - implementation TBD.

## Purpose

Define inputs and outputs for attention inference and action preparation.

## Key Concepts

- Attention signal ingestion contract.
- Inference confidence and uncertainty fields.
- Override hooks and inspectability metadata.

## Relationship to Polaris Architecture

Attention interface feeds Manager prioritization and confirmation loops.

## Open Questions

- What normalization model supports multi-device signal parity?
