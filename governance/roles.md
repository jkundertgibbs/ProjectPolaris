# Governance Roles

## Purpose

Specify baseline roles and responsibilities for Polaris operations.

## Key Concepts

- **CEO**: declares mission and top-level constraints.
- **Director**: decomposes missions into executable projects and tasks.
- **Researcher**: gathers evidence and options.
- **Executor**: performs assigned task work.
- **Verifier**: validates outputs against criteria.
- **Memory Manager**: maintains relevant context and retrieval quality.
- **Scrum Master**: optimizes flow and resolves blockers.
- **Bean Counter**: monitors budget and resource exposure.

## Relationship to Polaris Architecture

Roles map directly to delegation and escalation behavior in `manager/delegation.md` and `manager/feedback-loops.md`.

## Open Questions

- Which role combinations are safe to co-locate in one agent?
