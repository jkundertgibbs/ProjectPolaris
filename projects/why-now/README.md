# Why Now

## Problem Definition

Legacy computing models assume human-only execution and explicit command interfaces, which do not fit mixed human/AI delegation workflows.

## Proposed Polaris Solution

Reframe operating interactions around tasks and governance rather than files and app boundaries.

## Structural Outline

- Identify pressure points in terminal, desktop, and app-centric models.
- Define requirements introduced by autonomous agents.
- Map requirements to Polaris primitives (Board, Project, Task, Manager, Roles).

## Open Questions

- Which transition path is most practical for current teams?
- Which domains benefit first from MUX?
