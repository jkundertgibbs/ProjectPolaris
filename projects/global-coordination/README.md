# Global Coordination

## Problem Definition

Single-agent and single-device coordination models cannot represent distributed project execution across many human and AI managers.

## Proposed Polaris Solution

Support manager-to-manager task exchange with negotiation, policy constraints, and inspectable outcomes.

## Structural Outline

- Cross-manager protocol model.
- Task handoff and acceptance rules.
- Multi-party escalation and reconciliation.

## Open Questions

- What trust model is required for inter-manager exchange?
- How should cross-jurisdiction policy differences be enforced?
