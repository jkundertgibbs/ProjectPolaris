# Governance Model

## Problem Definition

AI-augmented execution requires explicit authority, accountability, and budget controls that are weakly modeled in current software stacks.

## Proposed Polaris Solution

Define formal roles, horizontal/vertical feedback loops, and escalation paths with inspectable decision records.

## Structural Outline

- Role responsibilities and boundaries.
- Feedback loop topology.
- Budget and risk governance hooks.

## Open Questions

- Which role transitions can be automatic vs approved?
- How should conflicting verifier outcomes be resolved?
