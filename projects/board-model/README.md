# Board Model

## Problem Definition

Current work surfaces are fragmented across apps and do not maintain a unified project hierarchy for mixed human/AI teams.

## Proposed Polaris Solution

Use Board as a stable activity surface with explicit links to Projects, Tasks, and recursive Subtasks.

## Structural Outline

- Board composition and project cards.
- Project decomposition patterns.
- Cross-role visibility and inspectability.

## Open Questions

- How should concurrent Boards synchronize priorities?
- What board affordances are required for low-friction override?
