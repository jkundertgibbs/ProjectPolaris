# Attention Privacy Boundaries

## Purpose

Define privacy and consent boundaries for attention-derived context.

## Key Concepts

- Data minimization for signal retention.
- Purpose-limited inference context.
- Explicit policy controls for sharing.

## Relationship to Polaris Architecture

Privacy boundaries constrain Manager learning and global coordination behavior.

## Open Questions

- Which signals must never leave local context?
