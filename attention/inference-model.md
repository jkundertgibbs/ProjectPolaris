# Attention Inference Model

## Purpose

Describe how attention signals are transformed into proposed actions.

## Key Concepts

- Signal intake from multi-environment inputs.
- Continuous inference pipeline with uncertainty tracking.
- Action preparation before execution.

## Relationship to Polaris Architecture

Inference outputs feed Manager delegation and task prioritization.

## Open Questions

- How should uncertainty thresholds vary by task risk class?
