# Manager Autonomy

## Purpose

Define unresolved boundaries for autonomous manager action.

## Key Concepts

- Autonomy tiers by risk class.
- Mandatory confirmation thresholds.
- Escalation fallback requirements.

## Relationship to Polaris Architecture

Constrained autonomy is central to `manager/delegation.md` and `attention/override-pattern.md`.

## Open Questions

- Which operations should remain permanently non-autonomous?
- How should autonomy adapt to observed reliability?
