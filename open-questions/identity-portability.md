# Identity Portability

## Purpose

Articulate unresolved requirements for moving manager identity across environments.

## Key Concepts

- Portable identity representation.
- Continuity proofs and recovery semantics.
- Interoperability across manager implementations.

## Relationship to Polaris Architecture

Identity portability underpins MUX and cross-manager coordination.

## Open Questions

- What minimum portable identity bundle is required?
- How should compromised identity states be revoked and restored?
