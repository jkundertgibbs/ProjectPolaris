# Open Questions

## Purpose

Track unresolved architectural decisions that affect Polaris feasibility and safety.

## Key Concepts

- Open questions are first-class design artifacts.
- Questions should be explicit, testable, and linked to impacted subsystems.
- Resolution should reference corresponding updates in `principles/` or `specs/`.

## Relationship to Polaris Architecture

This layer prevents implicit assumptions from hardening before review.

## Open Questions

- What review cadence should govern closure of major open questions?
