# Privacy Boundaries

## Purpose

Clarify unresolved privacy constraints for attention signals and manager memory.

## Key Concepts

- Signal minimization versus utility tradeoff.
- Retention windows and consent boundaries.
- Cross-manager sharing constraints.

## Relationship to Polaris Architecture

Directly impacts `attention/privacy.md` and `global/cross-manager-protocol.md`.

## Open Questions

- Which signal classes are always local-only?
- What consent model should gate policy overrides?
